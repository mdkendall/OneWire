    * Celsius temperature measurements and has an alarm function with 
    * nonvolatile user-programmable upper and lower trigger points. The 
    * DS18B20 communicates over a 1-Wire bus that by definition requires 
    * only one data line (and ground) for communication with a central 
    * microprocessor. In addition, the DS18B20 can derive power directly 
    * from the data line ("parasite power"), eliminating the need for an 
    * external power supply.
