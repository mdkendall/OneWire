    * @brief DS2413 1-Wire Dual Channel Addressable Switch
    *
    * @details The DS2413 is a dual-channel programmable I/O 1-Wire® 
    * chip. The PIO outputs are configured as open-drain and provide up
    * to 20mA continuous sink capability and off-state operating voltage
    * up to 28V. Control and sensing of the PIO pins is performed with 
    * a dedicated device-level command protocol. To provide a high level 
    * of fault tolerance in the end application, the 1-Wire I/O and PIO 
    * pins are all capable of withstanding continuous application of 
    * voltages up to 28V max. Communication and operation of the DS2413 
    * is performed with the single contact Maxim 1-Wire serial interface.
